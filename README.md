# :game_die: Addiction :slot_machine:

Addiction is a captivating role-playing game that explores the world of gambling and its consequences. In this game, you take on the role of a character navigating through a virtual casino, interacting with various gambling games and facing the challenges that come with addiction.

## :video_game: Gameplay

As you explore the casino, you'll encounter different gambling games such as Blackjack, Baccarat, and High-Low. Each game presents unique challenges and opportunities to win or lose money. Your goal is to manage your finances wisely and make strategic decisions to progress through the game.

Throughout your journey, you'll also encounter locked doors that require a fee to unlock. These doors lead to new areas of the casino, offering more gambling opportunities and challenges. Be cautious, as the temptation to spend money on unlocking doors can quickly drain your funds.

If your balance drops below -100, you will lose the game. So, be mindful of your spending and make wise choices to avoid bankruptcy.
